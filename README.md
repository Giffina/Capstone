## Overview
This simulation is meant to help prepare passengers for what to expect in the event of an emeregency landing. The user is meant to follow the directions and walk through the plane towards the exit and then enter the safety raft. This specific scenario is set in the middle of an ocean.
## Description
The simulation takes place in a commercial airplane in the middle of an ocean. The plane has a total of 12 passengers one of which is user controlled. Outside of the plane are 6 safety rafts where the 11 passengers will each find their seats. Inside the plane there is a seating section and on either sides of this are sections that are on fire.
## Installation
Have an updated version on Unity installed.
## Future
This simulation could be used as a template for different environments and scenarios.
